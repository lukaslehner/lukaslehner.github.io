This is the repository for my academic website: https://lukaslehner.github.io/.

I teach the use of tools for efficient workflows, collaboration and reproducibility for researchers. My [intro slides](https://lukaslehner.github.io/assets/transparency-outreach-slides.html) provide advice on how to build your website using Markdown and Git, and my [syllabus](https://www.gesis.org/fileadmin/upload/GESIS_Training/Syllabi_Methodenseminar/Fall_Seminar_2022/Fall_Seminar_2022_Week_1_Schulte-CloosLehner.pdf) includes a more extensive reading list.

The initial website theme is based on *[Academic](https://github.com/gaalcaras/academic)* by [Gabriel Alcaras](https://gaalcaras.com/en/). I have implemented a number of adjustments that you can find in this repository. Several people are already using my adjusted template. You can find some examples here for inspiration:
- [Jacopo Mazza](https://jacopoto.github.io/)
- [Burak Sonmez](https://brksnmz.github.io/)
- [Matthias Haslberger](https://matthiashaslberger.github.io/)
- [Birte Strunk](https://birtestrunk.github.io/)
- [Lisa Hanzl](https://lisahanzl.github.io/)
- [Carlos Revoredo](https://caerevoredo.github.io/)
- [Severin Rapp](https://severin-rapp.github.io/)

My academic CV is written in Markdown and converted to LaTeX using Knit. The template and code is based on [Alex Albright](https://github.com/apalbright/CV) and [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/).
