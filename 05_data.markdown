## Data
Transparency and reproducibility are core values guiding my research. I frequently collect primary data, which I aim to make accessible to the public. During the pandemic, I founded the Oxford Supertracker to assist researchers in navigating new data sources.

The Oxford Supertracker is a global directory of over several hundred policy trackers and surveys related to COVID-19. This novel collection is designed to assist researchers and policy-makers in keeping track of a rapidly growing number of data sources. You can search and identify relevant information resources, such as datasets, surveys, and systematic collections, across different areas, countries and data types.

The amount of COVID-19 related research being produced within the first weeks following the implementation of far-reaching lockdowns across the globe has been impressive. To keep track of new sources, I have compiled a collection of currently over 100 policy trackers and datasets on the topic. The compilation is not meant to be exhaustive and I am grateful for general feedback you may have or suggestions on new sources.

The study "Causes and Consequences of Unemployment in the COVID-19 pandemic" addresses the financial and psychological consequences of unemployment for those affected in the second year of the Corona pandemic. The study is based on an Austria-wide standardised telephone survey of 1844 people aged 15 to 64. The interviews took place between 29 May and 11 July 2021. 1215 interviewees were unemployed at the time of the interview, 332 of them long-term unemployed, 629 interviewees were employed.
