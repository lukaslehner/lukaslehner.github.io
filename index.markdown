### Hi,

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford, [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner#/){:target="_blank"} and at the [Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner/){:target="_blank"}. In the academic year 2022/23, I am a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley during fall and at MIT during spring.

My research focuses on labour market policies. In particular, I am studying the [causes for slow wage growth](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/publications/no-2022-04-begging-thy-coworker-labor-market-dualization-and-the-slow-down-of-wage-growth-in-europe/){:target="_blank"} in Europe, conducting a randomised control trial on a [pilot job guarantee scheme](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/Marienthal/){:target="_blank"} and have founded the [Oxford Supertracker: The Global Directory of COVID Policy Trackers and Surveys](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. 

My research has been awarded the Barnett Prize for the best paper at DSPI, University of Oxford, a Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy Grant and the UC Berkeley Fellowship of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation. My work has been featured by the Financial Times, CNN, Forbes and Nature in print and by ARTE, ZDF and ORF on TV. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked at the OECD Economics Department in Paris and the International Labour Organization in Geneva.
