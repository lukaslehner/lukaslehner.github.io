### Hi,

I am a PhD candidate in Social Policy at the [University of Oxford](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner#/){:target="_blank"}. I am also affiliated with Oxford University's [Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner/){:target="_blank"} and WU Vienna's [Research Institute Economics of Inequality](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/ineq/team/research-associates/lukas-lehner/){:target="_blank"}. In the academic year 2022/23, I am a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley during fall and at MIT during spring.

My resarch focuses on the consequences of labor market policies and institutions in a changing world of work. Examples include studies on the [Marienthal job guarantee](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cd25u/){:target="_blank"}, reframing active labor market policy, and [labor market dualization](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/publications/no-2022-04-begging-thy-coworker-labor-market-dualization-and-the-slow-down-of-wage-growth-in-europe/){:target="_blank"}. In 2020, I founded the [Oxford Supertracker](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, a global directory to understand policy responses to the pandemic.

My research has been awarded the Barnett Prize for the best paper at the University of Oxford DSPI, a Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy Grant and the UC Berkeley Fellowship of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation. My work has been featured by *The New Yorker*, *Financial Times*, *CNN* and *Nature* in print and by *ARTE*, *ARD*, and *ZDF* on TV. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked at the OECD Economics Department in Paris and the International Labour Organization in Geneva.
