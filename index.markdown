### Hi,

I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Oxford](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner#/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley and at MIT, and worked at the OECD and the International Labour Organization.

My research focuses on labor market policies in a changing world of work with a focus on unemployment and worker bargaining power. In 2020, I founded the [Oxford Supertracker](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} to understand policy responses to the pandemic.

My research has been awarded the Barnett Prize for the best paper at the University of Oxford DSPI, a Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy Grant and the UC Berkeley Fellowship of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation. My work has been featured by *The New Yorker*, *Financial Times*, CNN and *Nature* in print and by ARTE, ARD, and ZDF on TV.
