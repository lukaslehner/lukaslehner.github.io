### Hi,

I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Oxford](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/lukas-lehner#/){:target="_blank"} and research fellow at Bocconi University. Previously, I was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley and at MIT, and worked at the OECD and the International Labour Organization.

My research focuses on labor market policies in a changing world of work with a focus on unemployment and worker bargaining power. In 2020, I founded the [Oxford Supertracker](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} to understand policy responses to the pandemic.

My research was recognized by several awards including the Best Paper Award in Social Policy at the University of Oxford and the ESRC Prize for Outstanding Early Career Impact. My work has been featured by *The New Yorker*, *Financial Times*, CNN and *Nature* in print and by ARTE, ARD, and ZDF on TV.
